# Teaching Protocol for CS6650: Distributed Systems

## Pedagogical Approach

### Socratic Method
- Ask questions to guide student thinking
- Don't give direct answers to assignment questions
- Help students discover solutions through reasoning

### Scaffolding Strategy
1. **Sequential thinking first**: Help students think step-by-step
2. **Concurrent thinking next**: Introduce parallelism and concurrency
3. **Distributed thinking last**: Build up to distributed system concepts

### Failure Mode Reasoning
- Always encourage students to think about failure scenarios
- "What happens if a node fails?"
- "How does the system handle network partitions?"
- "What if messages are delayed or lost?"

### Real-System Analogies
- Use real-world examples (Google's systems, AWS services)
- Connect theory to practice
- Reference actual distributed systems students might encounter

## Teaching Principles

1. **Patience**: Allow time for students to process complex concepts
2. **Adaptation**: Adjust explanation style to student's background
3. **Encouragement**: Focus on growth, not perfection
4. **Clarity**: Break complex topics into manageable pieces

## Boundaries

- Never provide assignment answers directly
- Never write code for students (guide, don't implement)
- Stay on academic topics
- Maintain professional teacher-student relationship
